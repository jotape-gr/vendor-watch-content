Customer and end-user data flows to these external AI services for processing. While Intercom's AI Products guide addresses data handling, customers should verify whether conversation data is excluded from LLM provider training datasets and review data processing agreements for each region's AI provider. ISO 42001 certification demonstrates AI governance, but inherent privacy risks exist when sensitive customer conversations transit multiple third-party AI platforms.

## Overview

Intercom is an AI-powered customer service platform that enables businesses to communicate with customers through chat, email, SMS, and other messaging channels. The platform features Fin AI Agent, which uses large language models from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google to provide automated customer support, along with tools for human support teams including inbox management, help center, and customer data platform capabilities.

## Security & Compliance

Intercom maintains a comprehensive security program with ISO 27001:2022, ISO 42001:2023 (AI Management), SOC 2 Type II, HIPAA, and HDS (French Health Data Hosting v1.1) certifications. The platform is built on AWS infrastructure distributed across three availability zones in multiple regions (US, EU, Australia), providing 99.9% uptime SLA with disaster recovery capabilities. Public status page available at www.intercomstatus.com for real-time incident monitoring.

All data is encrypted in transit with TLS 256-bit encryption (A+ SSL Labs rating) and at rest using AES-256. Intercom implements zero trust security architecture with mandatory endpoint management, biometric authentication, and least privilege access controls. The platform undergoes annual third-party penetration testing and maintains an active bug bounty program via Bugcrowd.

Security controls include automated anti-virus scanning of all file uploads up to 100MB (executable files blocked), inbound email scanning for phishing/malware, network segmentation, endpoint encryption with remote wipe capabilities, and real-time endpoint monitoring. Security team contactable at security@intercom.io for vulnerability reports and concerns.

## AI Security & LLM Processing

Intercom's Fin AI products leverage multiple third-party LLM providers, which introduces data privacy considerations:
- **USA/Australia regions**: OpenAI, Anthropic, Google (US infrastructure)
- **EU region**: Microsoft Azure OpenAI Service, Google (EU infrastructure)  
- **Voice AI**: ElevenLabs (text-to-speech processing)

**Privacy Considerations**: Customer service conversations and end-user data are processed by these external AI providers. Organizations should verify:
- Whether conversation data is excluded from LLM training datasets
- Data processing agreements for each region's AI provider
- Acceptable use policies for sensitive customer information
- Human review workflows for AI-generated responses

**AI Hallucination Risk**: Fin AI may generate confident but incorrect responses, requiring monitoring and human oversight for sensitive customer inquiries.

The ISO/IEC 42001:2023 certification demonstrates responsible AI management practices and governance controls. Customers can review detailed security measures and data handling in the Intercom AI Products guide and Fin AI Security documentation available through the Trust Center.

## Data Protection & Privacy

Intercom offers regional data hosting with customer data stored in AWS facilities in USA (us-east-1), Dublin, Ireland (eu-west-1), or Sydney, Australia based on customer selection. The platform complies with GDPR, CCPA, HIPAA, and French HDS v1.1 requirements (v2 update expected March 2026) with comprehensive Data Processing Addendum including Standard Contractual Clauses for international transfers.

Intercom operates as a **data processor** for customer data sent to the platform, while customers remain the data controller. Intercom serves as data controller only for account and billing information. Customers retain all rights, title, and interest in their customer data. Data Protection Officer available at dataprotection@intercom.io for privacy inquiries and data subject requests.

Data retention policies specify workspace deletion within 30 days of customer request, with automatic deletion after 180 days of inactivity. Multi-tenancy protections ensure logical separation preventing data exposure between workspaces. Customer data portability features enable easy export and deletion in compliance with data protection regulations.

**Note:** Intercom is not FedRAMP authorized as of 2024, with no immediate plans for certification. Contact Intercom if FedRAMP is a requirement for your organization.

## Subprocessor Ecosystem

Intercom engages 12 subprocessors including major cloud providers (AWS, GCP), AI/LLM services (OpenAI, Anthropic, Microsoft Azure OpenAI, Google, ElevenLabs), email infrastructure (Mailgun, SparkPost), data platforms (Snowflake, PlanetScale), communications (Twilio), and security services (Cloudflare). Regional processing alignment ensures EU customers' AI data remains in EU when using Microsoft Azure OpenAI or Google EU infrastructure.

## Incident Response & Monitoring

Formal incident response procedures include 24/7 security team coverage, on-call engineering support, escalation protocols, and post-mortem analysis. All production activities generate audit logs shipped to Elasticsearch for analysis with S3/Glacier archival. Real-time endpoint monitoring detects and responds to threats automatically. Customers receive prompt written notification upon verification of any security breach affecting their data via the public status page.

## Access Controls & Authentication

Platform security features include SAML SSO integration (Okta, OneLogin), Google SSO, two-factor authentication (2FA), and granular teammate permissions for app settings, billing, user data access, and messaging capabilities. Customers can implement IP restrictions, custom session lengths, and review all critical changes via Teammate Activity Logs for workspace governance.
