shortDescription: >
  Conductrics is an A/B testing and optimization platform offering dedicated 
  server environments with customer-controlled data residency and optional 
  self-hosting capabilities. While the platform provides privacy-by-design 
  architecture and enterprise access controls, the absence of publicly 
  available security certifications and Trust Center limits transparency 
  into their security posture.

faqs:
  - title: What hosting options does Conductrics provide?
    description: >
      Conductrics offers two hosting models: (1) Fully-hosted dedicated servers 
      where each customer receives their own dedicated environment with choice 
      of geo-region and cloud provider, or (2) Optional self-hosting where 
      customers can host the JavaScript file containing tests and surveys, 
      or self-host the REST API for complete control. Self-hosting facilitates 
      compliance with strict Content-Security-Policies and reduces reliance 
      on third-party scripts.
  - title: How does Conductrics protect customer data privacy?
    description: >
      Conductrics employs privacy-by-design architecture that stores only the 
      minimum information required to run A/B tests and projects. For testing 
      and predictions, only aggregated reporting data is retained without 
      storing IP addresses or Customer IDs. For surveys, customers can bring 
      their own database to store individual responses, maintaining direct 
      control over survey data under their internal governance practices.
  - title: Is customer data co-mingled with other customers' data?
    description: >
      No. Each Conductrics customer receives their own dedicated environment. 
      Data is never co-mingled or stored with other companies' data. This 
      dedicated architecture ensures logical and physical separation of 
      customer data across the platform.
  - title: What deployment controls are available?
    description: >
      Conductrics provides Deploy Targets to separate staging and production 
      environments. Deploy targets can be assigned to specific teams for 
      controlled rollouts. Customers can optionally require separate 2FA/MFA 
      authentication specifically for deploying to production, adding an 
      additional security layer for production changes.
  - title: What access management features are supported?
    description: >
      Conductrics supports team-based organization with role-based access 
      controls. Users can be granted different permission levels: view-only 
      access to reports, ability to set up tests, or permission to deploy 
      to production. Two-Factor Authentication (TOTP 2FA/MFA) is supported, 
      with optional requirement for 2FA during production deployment. 
      SSO via SAML is also supported for enterprise authentication integration.
  - title: Does Conductrics have security certifications?
    description: >
      Conductrics does not publicly list traditional security certifications 
      such as ISO 27001, SOC 2, or other compliance frameworks. The company 
      does not maintain a traditional Trust Center. Customers requiring 
      detailed security documentation or compliance information should 
      contact Conductrics directly at info@conductrics.com to discuss 
      their specific requirements.
  - title: What QA and testing features are available?
    description: >
      Conductrics provides QA-Only Mode to keep new tests private until 
      ready for launch. Preview Links can be shared with other teams or 
      agencies to review progress. During QA, specific variations can be 
      pre-selected for testing, and detailed logs are available to verify 
      correct behavior before production deployment.
  - title: What notification and alerting capabilities exist?
    description: >
      Conductrics supports notifications via Email, Slack, or Google Chat. 
      Notifications include alerts when tests and surveys are started, 
      stopped, or promoted to production. Team members can subscribe to 
      daily updates about test progress. The platform also provides heads-up 
      alerts about Sample Ratio Mismatch (SRM) and other potential issues.
