      and brands removed per the Data Processing Addendum requirements.
  - title: What happened in the August 2025 security breach?
    description: >
      In August 2025, Drift experienced a critical security breach where a financially
      motivated threat group exploited Drift platform integrations to access connected
      systems, potentially affecting over 700 organizations. The breach was initially
      believed to impact only Salesforce-integrated customers but was later found
      to affect a broad array of third-party integrations. Salesloft recommended

      firms to investigate the full extent of the breach.
  - title: How does Drift handle data retention and deletion?

      Drift provides self-service data retention controls where customers determine
      retention periods and can delete data through the UI, APIs, or CRM synchronization

      exports, after which the data is deleted as outlined in the Master Subscription
      Agreement.
  - title: What encryption does Drift use?

      Drift employs storage-layer encryption using AES-256-GCM for all customer
      data at rest, in addition to hardware-layer full-disk encryption from IaaS
