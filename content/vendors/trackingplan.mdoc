faqs:
  - title: What is Trackingplan's data retention policy?
    description: >
      Trackingplan automatically deletes all customer data after 90 days. This 
      automated retention policy aligns with storage limitation principles and 
      data minimization requirements, ensuring data is kept only as long as 
      necessary for data observability and anomaly detection purposes.
  - title: How does Trackingplan protect user privacy?
    description: >
      Trackingplan implements privacy-by-design with on-device anonymization and 
      masking. Personal data is removed directly on the user's device through 
      local parsing before any data transmission. The platform does not store 
      IP addresses or fingerprinting data, and offers an optional Privacy SDK 
      to mask sensitive information at the source.
  - title: What encryption does Trackingplan use?
    description: >
      All data is encrypted in transit using TLS 1.2+ and at rest using AES-256 
      encryption. Infrastructure is hosted on hardened AWS PaaS services with 
      granular IAM controls, least-privilege access enforcement, and comprehensive 
      encryption key management practices verified through independent technical review.
  - title: Does Trackingplan have security certifications?
    description: >
      Trackingplan maintains a comprehensive Comply.org Trust Center with 
      independent legal and technical security reviews (October 2024). Legal 
      assessment by CIPP/E/US certified attorney validates data protection 
      principles and DPA compliance. Technical assessment by CIPT certified 
      privacy engineer validates security measures and technical controls. 
      Contact dpo@trackingplan.com for additional documentation.
  - title: How does Trackingplan handle data subject requests?
    description: >
      Trackingplan has established procedures for handling GDPR data subject 
      requests including access, rectification, erasure, portability, and 
      objection rights. The platform supports these requests through documented 
      response timelines and verification processes. Contact the DPO at 
      dpo@trackingplan.com for data subject inquiries.
  - title: What access controls does Trackingplan implement?
    description: >
      Role-based access control (RBAC) with OAuth 2 authentication is enforced 
      across all infrastructure. Access is managed through granular IAM roles 
      with least-privilege principles. Company-wide Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) 
      is mandatory for all team members. All access is logged via audit logs 
      with 24/7 on-call monitoring, sessions automatically expire after inactivity, 
      and CSRF/session-fixation attack protection. CI/CD deployment pipelines 
      require peer-reviewed code changes before production deployment.
  - title: How does Trackingplan monitor for privacy issues?
    description: >
      Trackingplan provides automated Privacy Audit monitoring for accidental 
      private data leaks to third-party vendors with real-time alerts. Consent 
      Validation verifies that no data is sent when users opt out via Consent 
      Mode or similar mechanisms, alerting whenever a vendor receives data 
      contravening user choice. Configurable PII rules using flexible regex 
      patterns or vendor-specific presets detect and scrub sensitive data in 
      real-time before transmission.
  - title: What is Trackingplan's approach to data minimization?
    description: >
      Trackingplan SDK only inspects network requests that sites or apps already 
      send to third-party vendors (e.g., Google Analytics, Meta). All data parsing, 
      anonymization, and masking happens directly on the user's device before 
      anything is sent to Trackingplan's servers. The platform does not introduce 
      new identifiers, does not store IP addresses or fingerprinting data, does 
      not use cookies, and implements 90-day auto-deletion. Local request inspection 
      with in-browser/app processing ensures data minimization principles verified 
      through legal compliance review.
  - title: Does Trackingplan use cookies or user IDs?
    description: >
      No, Trackingplan does not store or collect any personal data. The platform 
      does not use cookies for tracking. The SDK only uses local storage for 
      local operation and never transmits that information to servers. If sites 
      send user IDs to analytics vendors, Trackingplan inspects these requests 
      but never stores, links, or enriches IDs with additional information. All 
      data is anonymized or masked on the user's device before forwarding. 
      Trackingplan does not use fingerprinting and never introduces new tracking 
      mechanisms or builds user profiles.
  - title: Where are Trackingplan's servers located?
    description: >
      Trackingplan infrastructure runs exclusively on AWS PaaS in customer-selected 
      regions. EU clients have data stored and processed in EU data centers, US 
      clients in US data centers. All endpoints are protected via AWS WAF with 
      TLS 1.2+ encryption and AES-256 at rest. Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs) 
      and EU Standard Contractual Clauses are in place for cross-border data transfers.
  - title: Is Trackingplan's installation script secure?
    description: >
      Yes. The Trackingplan installation script is lightweight (<10KB), loads 
      asynchronously, and does not block page execution. Served directly as source 
      code to eliminate unauthorized changes risk. Thoroughly reviewed by security-conscious 
      clients including data-driven organizations and privacy-focused teams. Works 
      only on declared endpoints for monitoring, performs anonymization locally 
      without external dependencies, and never introduces new cookies, storage 
      mechanisms, or cross-site tracking. Decompiled version available under NDA 
      for additional assurance.
