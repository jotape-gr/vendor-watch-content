## Overview

MuleSoft (a Salesforce company) is an enterprise integration and API management platform providing the Anypoint Platform, MuleSoft Composer, and Robotic Process Automation (RPA) services. The platform enables API-led connectivity for connecting applications, data, and devices across on-premises and cloud environments.

Operating on a multi-tenant architecture with logical data separation, MuleSoft provides enterprise-grade security controls including ISO 27001:2022, SOC 2 Type II, PCI DSS Level 1, and ISO 42001:2023 (AI Management) certifications. The platform supports HIPAA Business Associate Agreements and maintains comprehensive compliance with data protection regulations including GDPR through Data Privacy Framework certifications and EU/UK Binding Corporate Rules for Processors.

MuleSoft's infrastructure is primarily hosted on Amazon Web Services (AWS) with data residency options across 13+ global regions enabling customers to meet data sovereignty requirements. The platform undergoes annual third-party penetration testing and maintains disaster recovery capabilities with geographically diverse facilities tested annually.

## Security & Compliance

### Architecture & Data Protection

MuleSoft Cloud Offerings operate in a multi-tenant architecture designed to segregate and restrict Customer Data access based on business needs. The architecture provides logical data separation for different customers via Organization IDs and allows customer and user role-based access privileges. Additional data segregation is ensured by providing separate environments for testing and production functions.

Customer applications deployed on MuleSoft run within single-tenant environments that customers can configure based on their internal security requirements. Applications are automatically replicated on a near real-time basis at the database layer and backed up as part of the deployment process on secure, access-controlled, and redundant storage.

### Authentication & Access Control

Access to MuleSoft Services requires valid user ID and password combinations, encrypted via SSL/TLS in transit with passwords stored using one-way salted hashing. The platform supports Single Sign-On (SSO) utilizing SAML 2.0 with Public Key Cryptography, eliminating the need to store passwords. Following successful authentication, randomly-generated time-scoped credentials are transmitted to users' browsers or command-line interfaces for session management.

Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is available for access to MuleSoft Cloud Offerings. User access log entries are maintained containing date, time, user ID, resource accessed, operation performed, and source IP address to enable security reviews and forensic analysis.

### Encryption & Data Security

Transport Layer Security (TLS) is required for all management plane MuleSoft Cloud Offerings and available as an option for runtime plane services. Runtime plane services default to encryption, with customers maintaining control over protocol and encryption configuration for runtime applications as documented in product documentation.

Data in transit is protected through TLS 1.2 or higher, preventing unauthorized interception during transmission. Customer login passwords are stored using one-way salted hash algorithms. All MuleSoft systems log information to system log facilities or centralized logging services to enable security reviews and analysis.

### Security Monitoring & Testing

Salesforce or authorized independent third parties continuously monitor MuleSoft Cloud Offerings for unauthorized intrusions. The platform analyzes data collected by web browsers (device type, screen resolution, time zone, OS version, browser type and version, system fonts, installed plugins, enabled MIME types) for security purposes including fraud prevention and ensuring proper functionality.

Security scans and testing of customer code uploaded to the platform detect abusive behavior or actions violating MuleSoft Services terms. Annual security assessments by internal personnel and third parties include infrastructure vulnerability assessments and application security assessments.

MuleSoft's penetration testing policy allows customers to perform vulnerability assessments and penetration testing on their applications hosted on Anypoint Platform without prior notification, subject to the Security Assessment Agreement and restrictions preventing interference with other tenants.

Customer Data submitted to MuleSoft is covered by Data Privacy Framework certifications (EU-US, UK Extension to EU-US, and Swiss-US) as administered by the US Department of Commerce. The platform implements Standard Contractual Clauses for international data transfers ensuring compliance with European data protection requirements.

Data residency options are available across 13+ geographic regions including United States, Brazil, Canada, Australia, Japan, Singapore, South Korea, Germany, France, Ireland, Sweden, United Kingdom, and India. Customers can select their preferred region during setup or request migration to meet data sovereignty and local compliance requirements.

### Business Continuity & Disaster Recovery

MuleSoft maintains comprehensive Business Continuity Plans ensuring continuous operations through documented recovery procedures, backup strategies, and tested incident response protocols. The enterprise resilience framework maintains service availability during disruptive events with regular testing validation.

Disaster recovery facilities are geographically diverse from primary data centers, equipped with required hardware, software, and internet connectivity. Annual disaster recovery testing validates the ability to failover or restore services from primary to secondary locations utilizing operational and disaster recovery procedures.

Production data centers have access system controls, are designed to withstand adverse weather and natural conditions, and are secured by 24/7 guards, two-factor access screening, escort-controlled access, and on-site backup generators for power failures.

### Incident Response & Security Management

Security incident management policies and procedures establish notification protocols for unauthorized Customer Data disclosure. The Incident Response Plan establishes detection, analysis, containment, eradication, and recovery procedures with defined roles, communication protocols, and post-incident review processes for effective security incident management.

Salesforce notifies impacted customers without undue delay of any unauthorized disclosure of their Customer Data by Salesforce or its agents to the extent permitted by law. Security logs are maintained across all systems used in provision of MuleSoft Cloud Offerings to enable security reviews and analysis.

### Vulnerability Management

MuleSoft has addressed historical critical vulnerabilities through transparent disclosure and timely patching:

### Shared Responsibility Model

MuleSoft operates on a shared responsibility model where Salesforce manages platform security, infrastructure maintenance, security updates, and core compliance controls. Customers are responsible for configuring security features to meet organizational policies, managing user access controls, and ensuring applications follow company security requirements.

Customer applications have the ability to configure security based on internal requirements. Customers can control protocols and encryption for runtime applications as indicated in product documentation. MuleSoft provides full transparency into security controls through detailed documentation, compliance certifications, and regular third-party audit reports available through the compliance portal.

### Data Handling & Retention

During subscription terms, customers may make copies of Customer Data submitted to MuleSoft Cloud Offerings. Customers can request assistance from MuleSoft support up to 30 days after contract termination.

After termination and expiration of the 30-day support period, Customer Data is overwritten or deleted from production within 90 days, subject to applicable legal requirements. Transaction Processing Information for MuleSoft Anypoint Partner Manager is retained for 18 months from transaction processing date, after which it may be deleted.

### Infrastructure & Sub-processors
