      This vendor has shown up repeatedly in CIPA (California Invasion of
      Privacy Act) and related private enforcement actions under similar
      anti-wiretapping laws. These lawsuits are primarily aimed at Data
      Controllers, but session replay technologies have become an easier target
      due to their analogy to old wiretapping scenarios.
