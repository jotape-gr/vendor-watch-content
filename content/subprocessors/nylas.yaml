  Email and calendar API platform providing integration services for Microsoft Exchange, Google Workspace, and other email/calendar providers. Synchronizes email content, calendar events, and contact information for unified communication management.
description: |
  Medium risk due to extensive access to email and calendar data containing PII and sensitive business information. Implements OAuth-based authentication and encryption, but processes full email contents and calendar event details. Email synchronization increases data access scope. Consider data retention policies, access controls, and end-user consent mechanisms. Evaluate GDPR compliance for EU data processing and cross-border data transfer safeguards.
