usage: |
  In-memory database service providing high-performance data storage and caching. Hosts application data and provides fast data access infrastructure.
description: |
  Medium risk due to data storage sensitivity and memory-based data processing. Implements strong encryption and access controls, but processes application data in memory that may contain sensitive business information. Consider data classification and access controls for cache data. Evaluate data retention policies and cross-border data transfer implications. Assess memory encryption and access logging capabilities.
