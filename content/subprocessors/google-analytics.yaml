description: |
  Medium risk due to extensive data collection scope and Google's advertising ecosystem integration. Implements data minimization and user consent controls, but data may be used for advertising purposes beyond analytics. GDPR compliance features available but require proper configuration. Consider data retention policies and user opt-out mechanisms. Potential for cross-site tracking and data correlation across Google services.
